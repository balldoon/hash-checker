# hash-checker Python based hash checker
The script will read in a locally stored file and produce a hash from it (MD5, SHA1 & SHA2). This hash can then be compared to a one from the vendors download site so you can verify files you download aren’t corrupted or tampered with.

This was built to help me learn Python, there is no error checking built into this so any any attempt to put the wrong data in will result in the script failing.

Run the script from the command line
Options 1 & 2 will convert the hashes to the correct case
Option 3, 4 & 5 will create and check the hashes
